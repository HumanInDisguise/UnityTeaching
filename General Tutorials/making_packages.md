# Making Asset Packages in Unity

## Introduction

Sometimes you'll need to send someone some of your project – it might be a prefab you've developed, or a whole scene you need to send to your instructor for debugging.

This tutorial is to walk you through creating a **UnityPackage**. A **UnityPackage** is a way to make sure you send all of the relevant files, scripts, materials, etc. all still correctly joined up.

## Sending a Scene

- Open your project in Unity.
- Find your scene in the **Project** tab.
- Right-click on the scene, and select **Export package…**
