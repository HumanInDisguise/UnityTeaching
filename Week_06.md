# Week 06: Top-Down Shooter

## Introduction

In this series of workshops, you’ll be building a top-down or isometric shooter game. Notable differences to your Myst-like / Island game include:

- 2.5D or isometric graphics
- A follow-cam
- AI agents
- Navigation mesh that allow the bad guys to chase you around corners
- projectiles
- health and damage, including user interface
- and a greater emphasis on hand-eye coordination and reaction-based gameplay

### Group Work

For this project, you are encouraged to work in pairs. Two people is the default number of people per team.

In certain circumstances, you may work solo or in a group of three—but these arrangements are to made by special negotiation with your tutor. All partners need to be in your own workshop.

We suggest you try to work with someone that has complimentary skills to your own. For example, if you love your coding, find an artist who focuses on environment and props. If you love your modeling and animation and want to focus on that, you may be able to form a group of 3.

As before - (but this time, with stricter adherence) - we’ll run to concurrent projects.

1. SOLO WORKSHOP PROJECT

    - keep this safe and backed up on your Media Server drive
    - add to it each week
    - use this project for experimentation

2. GROUP ASSIGNMENT PROJECT

   - Worked on by both team members
   - Each member is expected to give 7 hours of self-directed time to the project per week. ie. a pair will contribute 14 hours to each project per week as ‘homework’.
   - The final project should look like 70 hours of work in total.

### Initial Assets

You’ll find a range of initial assets on Stream. Download all of those now and let’s make a start on our workshop projects.

## Setting Up

1. Create a project in the regular way

2. Once Unity has loaded, in the Assets root folder, create a **TopDownShooter** folder, and 10 new folders and name them as follows:
- TopDownShooter
    - Audio
    - Effects
    - Fonts
    - Images
    - Materials
    - Models
    - Prefabs
    - Scenes
    - Scripts
    - Textures

> Pay careful attention to capitalisation and spelling.
    
3. Import the TopDownShooter_Assets.unitypackage from the Stream site.

> Note how your assets are placed into the correct folders.

4. In the top file menu Save As and call the scene Level01Workshop_v01

> Make sure it’s saved to the **TopDownShooter>Scenes** folder.
